The year-long training programme provides Entrepreneurs-in-Training (EITs) with MBA-level entrepreneurship training in business, software development and communications.

While diving deep into fundamental business and technology concepts, EITs complete 3 Capstones per year - they form teams, come up with an idea, build and validate a product, attain customers and pitch the idea in front of our board.

The year culminates in a final exam in the form of an investor pitch, after which some companies will receive seed funding and enter the MEST Incubator.
